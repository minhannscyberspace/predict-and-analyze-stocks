# Stock Price Prediction and Analysis Using Deep Learning

## Description
This project uses deep learning techniques to predict stock prices based on historical stock data. 
I employ Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a specialized type of recurrent neural network (RNN) suited for time-series forecasting. 
The model is trained to analyze stock price trends and provide predictive insights.
Some of the key highlights include:
- Prediction and visualization of Google stock prices
- Application of various deep learning algorithms
- Flexible architecture that works with any company's stock data
- Cloud and cross-platform compatibility

## Key Features
- Stock Price Forecasting â€“ Predicts future stock prices using LSTM-based deep learning models.
- Interactive Visualizations â€“ Displays stock trends, actual vs. predicted prices, and moving averages.
- Compatible with local systems and cloud platforms
- Easily extensible to different stock datasets
- This model's architecture:
  - LSTM Layers â€“ For handling sequential time-series data
  - Dense Layers â€“ Fully connected neural network layers for prediction
  - Dropout Layers â€“ To prevent overfitting
  - Dropout layers for regularization
